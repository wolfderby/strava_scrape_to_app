**Shadcn UI** is a user interface (UI) library that provides accessible and customizable components¹. It's built with **Radix UI** and **Tailwind CSS**, and it's designed to be used in your applications¹. 

The unique feature of Shadcn UI is that it's not just a component library, but a collection of reusable components that you can directly copy and paste into your applications². This makes it a breath of fresh air in the world of UI tools².

It combines the best features of Tailwind and Radix UI, offering high customizability like Tailwind, along with a set of ready-made components like Radix UI⁴. This makes Shadcn UI a good choice for developers who want the flexibility of Tailwind with the convenience of a component library⁴.
