# Difference Between pip and conda

`pip` and `conda` are both package managers, but they serve different purposes and are often used in different contexts. Below are some of the key differences between the two:

## pip

1. **Purpose**: Primarily used to install Python packages.
2. **Ecosystem**: Part of the Python Software Foundation.
3. **Package Sources**: Packages are downloaded from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
4. **Package Type**: Installs Python packages only.
5. **Dependencies**: Installs Python package dependencies but does not handle environment-level dependencies.
6. **Environment Isolation**: Can be used with `virtualenv` to create isolated Python environments.
7. **Compatibility**: Generally used for Python-only environments and is language-agnostic.

```bash
# Install a Python package
pip install package_name
```

## conda

1. **Purpose**: Used to install packages for multiple languages and also manage environments.
2. **Ecosystem**: Part of the Anaconda distribution but can be used standalone.
3. **Package Sources**: Packages are downloaded from Anaconda repositories.
4. **Package Type**: Can install non-Python packages.
5. **Dependencies**: Manages both Python and non-Python dependencies.
6. **Environment Isolation**: Built-in environment management.
7. **Compatibility**: Can be used in multi-language data science projects.

```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create --name env_name

# Install a package
conda install package_name
```
